# Dissertation testing
This repository contains a series of examples and experiments related to my dissertation project, "Developing Accessible User Interfaces for Machine Learning Models." The goal of this repository is to test various frameworks, tools, and approaches for building interactive machine learning applications. The tests focus on integrating Django, Gradio, Streamlit, and PyKale, as well as other relevant technologies.

## Repository Structure
- **`/django_examples/`**: Contains examples of using Django to build web interfaces for machine learning models integrating with PyKale.

- **`/gradio_examples/`**: Contains examples of using Gradio to build real-time, interactive machine learning applications integrating with PyKale.

- **`/streamlit_examples/`**: Contains examples demonstrating how Streamlit can be integrated with PyKale.

- **`/pykale_examples/`**: Contains examples demonstrating how PyKale can works testing different examples.
